# BeadSpring model for flexible fibers in Stokes flow

This package contains python codes to run a simulation of several fibers at low Reynolds number. The fiber is
discretizes as a serie of spherical beads connected by spring constrains. The motion of each bead in Stokes flow is
given by the mobility relation, which relates the bead velocities to external forces applied on each bead.
